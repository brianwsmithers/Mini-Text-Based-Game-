Dungeon Entrance. You reached the top of a mountain and see an entrance leading into the side of it. A tall sturdy door is blocking the entrance. You wonder what is beyond that door.
Dark Cave. You enter through the door and see stalagmites scattered across the floor space. The light in this area is dim but as you look up you see stalactites hanging from the ceiling. Water is dripping and you manage to catch a small drop on your tongue.
Dragon's Lair. It's much brighter in this area. A cavern above you is the source of the light. Your hair raises and goosebumps form as you see an empty nest that is ghastly in size.
Underground Lake. You venture deep into the cave and notice the surrounding air feels different. The air feels cool and humid. As you look around, you realize a lake before you. You wonder if anything is living in the lake.
Cave Corridor. As you move onward, the space becomes narrow but you manage to fit in between the tight space around you.
Treasure Room. The path behind you is a somewhat gentle decline. You must be deep inside the cave by now. A small cavern above you is providing light. Your eyes open wide as you realize the fortune in front of you. You've come across a room full of treasure.
Bone Graveyard. As you proceed further, you are forced to suddenly stop. A rush of foul air fills your lungs and stuns you. The air is truly repugnant. Fear sets in as you take in the contents of the room. Bones, rotting carcasses and blood stains are scattered throughout. It is clear that something dangerous lives in this mountain.
